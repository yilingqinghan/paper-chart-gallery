### üìù How to Add a New Paper

1. **Get the BibTeX**  
   Go to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), find the paper, click the quotation mark üìñ icon, and copy the **BibTeX**.

2. **Add Extra Fields**  
   Please improve the BibTeX with the following fields:

   - `link` ‚Äì The DOI or paper URL (if available).  
     _Example_:  

     ```bibtex
     link = {https://doi.org/10.1145/1234567.1234568},
     ```

   - `keywords` ‚Äì A list of your own chosen keywords (comma-separated).  
     _Example_:  

     ```bibtex
     keywords = {auto-tuning, LLVM, reinforcement learning},
     ```

   - `abstract` ‚Äì Copy and paste the abstract of the paper.

3. **Save the Entry**  
   Place the enhanced BibTeX entry at the **end of the appropriate category file** in the `bib/` directory.  
   For example, if the paper is about code optimization, add it to `bib/code_optimization.bib`.

4. **Fork & Clone the Repo**

   cd scripts
   python 01-bib2md.py    # converts bib to papers/*.md
   python 02-bib2json.py  # updates index.json
   cd ..
   ```

7. **Preview the Site (Optional)**

   npm install -g serve
   serve scripts
   ```

   Then open the URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
